# TennisBookingSystem
Booking tennis courts during the winter season can be challenging. To address this issue, I used Selenium to automate the booking of courts via the Chrome browser and a cron scheduler. Additionally, I utilized Streamlit, a Python UI module, for selecting reservation times and courts.

# How to run? 
streamlit run main.py
